Automatic Rain-Sensing Wiper System
Overview

This project is an Automatic Rain-Sensing Wiper System using Arduino. It detects rainfall using a rain sensor and adjusts the wiper speed accordingly. LEDs indicate the current speed level, and an additional servo acts as a speed indicator.
Features

    Automatic wiper control based on rain intensity.
    Five-speed levels, from off to maximum speed.
    LED indicators for visual feedback.
    Speed indicator servo to display wiper speed.

How to Use

    Assemble the components and upload the code.
    Power on the system.
    Simulate rain on the sensor to test different speed levels.
    Observe wiper movement and LED indications.

Future Improvements

    Add an LCD display for real-time status.
    Implement a manual override switch.
    Use a DC motor with a relay for a more realistic wiper system.
