Automatic Rain-Detection and Wiper Control System
Overview

This project is an Automated Rain-Detection and Wiper Control System designed to adjust wiper speed based on rainfall intensity. It utilizes signal processing techniques with an amplifier, comparator circuit, priority encoder, and H-bridge motor driver to control motor speed.
Features

    Automatic wiper speed adjustment across four levels based on rain intensity.
    Signal processing integration, including amplifiers, comparators, and encoders.
    H-bridge motor driver for precise wiper motion control.
    LED indicators for real-time visual feedback on speed levels.

How It Works

    The rain sensor detects rainfall and generates an analog signal.
    The amplifier boosts the signal, which is then processed by comparators to classify rain intensity into four levels.
    A priority encoder and decoder convert the signal into control outputs.
    Relays and an H-bridge motor driver adjust the wiper motor speed accordingly.
    LEDs and a speed indicator provide real-time feedback.

How to Use

    Assemble the circuit as per the design.
    Upload the code to the microcontroller.
    Power on the system.
    Test by simulating rain on the sensor and observing the wiper speed changes.

Future Improvements

    LCD display for real-time rain intensity and speed levels.
    Manual override switch for user control.
    Integration with a vehicleâ€™s existing wiper system for real-world application.
